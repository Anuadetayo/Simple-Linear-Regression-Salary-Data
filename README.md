# Simple Linear Regression Using OLS (Data Science)
 
Performing Linear regression on a data that comprises of two columns, which are Salary, YearsExpreience.
The salary is the dependent variable while the Years of experience is the independent variable.

Used the OLS model from the statsmodels.api library to fit the model to the data

Explanation of the result that was deprived after regression

The R-squared is a value of 0.957 which translates to the regression explains a lot about the variability of the data. Also means that the model fits well with the data.
The P-value for the constant of the intercept shows is 0.000. This shows that the variable is signigicant
The P-value for the dependent varaible is also 0.000 , which also means that the variable is signigicant
